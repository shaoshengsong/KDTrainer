    "output": "I am a plump red apple, wearing a 'coat' that's half red and half yellow, with a surface as smooth as if waxed. The stem on my top is my 'pigtail'; gently touching it, you can feel the juicy flesh beneath my skin gently swaying. Bring me close to your nose, and a sweet, fresh fragrance will sneak into your nostrils—that's me inviting you to take a bite!"

    "output": "Methods to extend the shelf life of apples include: ① Refrigeration: Place in the refrigerator's chill compartment (temperature 0-4°C), wrap in a plastic bag (leave a small hole for ventilation), which can preserve them for 1-2 months; ② Avoid mixing: Keep apples separate from ethylene-releasing fruits like bananas and pears to prevent accelerated ripening; ③ Cool, ventilated place: Store at room temperature in a cool, dry area, suitable for short-term consumption lasting 1-2 weeks."

    "instruction": "Compare the core differences between apples and pears (from taste and nutritional focus)",
    "input": "Differences between apples and pears",
    "output": "In terms of taste: Apple flesh is mostly crisp (except for mealy varieties), with relatively thin skin; pear flesh tends to be delicate and juicy, with some varieties (like Ya pears) having smoother skin. Regarding nutritional emphasis: Apples are richer in dietary fiber (especially pectin), which aids intestinal motility; pears contain more water and sorbitol, making them more effective for moistening the lungs and quenching thirst, thus more suitable for dry seasons."
